```ad-summary

The definition of a metric space, an isometry, a geodesic line, ray, and segment. The definition of a metric on $\sph_n$ , with the proof of the triangle inequality, the classification of geodesic segments, and the law of cosines.

Definitions of hyperbolic segments, angles, the law of cosines, and the proof of the triangle inequality.
