title: Geodesic Segment and Locally Geodesic Segment
A <u>geodesic segment</u> of length $a$ in a [[metric space]] $(X,d)$ $l:[0,a]\to X$ is an [[Isometry|isometric embedding]] of the interval $[0,a]$ into $X$. A continuous map $l:[0,a]\to X$ is a <u>locally geodesic segment</u> if for $t\in [0,a]$, there exists $\eps>0$ such that $l\rest l^{-1}(B_\eps(l(t)))$ is an isometric embedding.

title: $D$ Geodesic Metric Space
A metric space $(X,d)$ is <u>$D$ geodesic</u> if for all $x,y\in X$ with $d(x,y)< D$, then there exists a geodesic segment from $x$ to $y$. 

If a metric space is $\infty$ geodesic, then it is just called <u> geodesic</u>.
