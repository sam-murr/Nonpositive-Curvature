title:Definition: Spaces with Curvature $\leq \kappa$
Let $(M,d)$ be a metric space. If $(M,d)$ is locally a $\CAT(\kappa)$ (at every point there is a small enough open ball that is $\CAT(\kappa)$ with the induced metric), then it has curvature $\leq \kappa$.

If a space is has curvature $\leq 0$ (ie i is locally $\CAT(0$)), then we call it non-positively curved.
