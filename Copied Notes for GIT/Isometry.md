title: Definition: Isometry and Isometric Embedding
A map $f:X\to Y$ between [[Metric Space|metric spaces]] $(X,d)$ to $(Y,d)$ is an <u>isometric embedding</u> if for all $x,z\in X$, $d(x,y) = d(f(x),f(y))$. It is an <u>isometry</u> if it is surjective.
```
```ad-note
Note that an isometry is a [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphism]] with respect to the [[Metric Space|metric space topology]].

title: Definition: Local Isometry
A map $f:X\to Y$ between [[Metric Space|metric spaces]] $(X,d)$ to $(Y,d)$ is an <u>local isometry</u> if for all $x\in X$ there is $\eps>0$ such that $f\rest B_\eps(x)$ is an isometry to $B_\eps(f(x))$.
