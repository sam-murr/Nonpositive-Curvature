### The Klein Model

```ad-Definition
title:Definition: The Klein Model of the Hyperbolic Plane
Consider the projection of $\HP^n\subseteq\R^{n+1}$ to the unit disc $\D^n$ where $x\in\HP^n$ gets mapped to the unique $y\in\D^n$ in the interior of the disc such that $(y_1,\dots,y_n, 1)$ is on the line from $0$ to $x$.

The <u>cross ratio</u> of four colinear points $x,y,w,z\in\D^n$ is:
$$
(x,y\ ;\ w,z) = \frac{\overline{wy}\ \overline{xz}}{\overline{wx}\ \overline{yz}}
$$

For points $x,y\in\D^n$ in the interior, let $l$ be the line connecting them and let $x_\infty$, $y_\infty$ on $l\cap\partial \D^n$ such that going along $l$ in the $x$ to $y$ direction the order of points you encounter is $x_\infty$, $x$, $y$, $y_\infty$. Then, define the distance $d$ from $x$ to $y$ as:
$$
d(x,y) = \frac{1}{2}\log(x,y\ ;\ x_\infty,y_\infty)
$$
