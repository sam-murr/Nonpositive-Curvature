```ad-Definition
Let $C\subseteq X$ be a complete [[Convex Subspace|convex subset]] of a $\CAT(0)$ space, then the projection map $\pi_C:X\to C$ is the map $x\mapsto x'$ where $x'\in C$ unique with $d(x',x) = \inf_{y\in C}\ d(y,x)$.
```

```ad-Proposition
title:Proposition: Properties of the Projection Map
- The projection map is well defined.
- For any $y\in C$, $y\neq \pi_C(x)$, then the alexandrov angle at $\pi(x)$ between geodesics $\pi(x)x$ and $\pi(x)y$, the angle is $\geq \pi/2$
- For $x,y\in X$, show that $d(\pi(x),\pi(y))\leq d(x,y)$
